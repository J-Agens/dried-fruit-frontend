## Chatroom App
This is a web application that allows users to create an account send messages in a chatroom. A message can be liked by clicking the heart next to it. Currently, there is only one chatroom.

## Background
This project was created as a part of the immersive web development program at Flatiron School in 2019 by John Agens and Yevgeniy Sobolev. Our goal was to create a basic chat application that would allow users to send messages back and forth in real time.

**Username: Yev** <br />

Or you can create your own account by clicking the Sign Up button on the homescreen.
You might have to wait a few seconds and refresh to make sure the backend is awake because it's hosted on a free Heroku account.
